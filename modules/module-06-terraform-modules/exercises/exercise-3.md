# ðŸ§± Exercise 3: Compose Multiple Modules

## Objective

Combine your bucket and IAM modules into a single root project.

---

## Steps

âœ… In your root project, create `main.tf` that calls both modules  
âœ… Add shared variables if needed  
âœ… Run:

```bash
terraform plan
terraform apply
```

âœ… See how both modules are created and tracked in state

## Reflection
- Why is separating logic into modules useful when scaling infrastructure?
