# 📝 Exercise 1: Build the Data Lake Infrastructure

## Objective

Combine everything to create an end-to-end data lake setup!

---

## Steps

✅ Create a new directory for your project (`data-lake-final/`).  
✅ Use separate `.tf` files (`main.tf`, `variables.tf`, `outputs.tf`).  
✅ Use modules for:
- S3 buckets
- Glue Data Catalog
- VPC
- IAM roles

✅ Initialize and deploy:

```bash
terraform init
terraform apply
```

## Reflection
What was the most challenging part of putting it all together?

How did using modules help keep things organized?
