# 💧 Module 07: AWS Data Lake Architecture and Components

Welcome to **Module 07**! In this module, we’ll explore the **key building blocks** of an AWS data lake and see how Terraform helps deploy them.

---

## 📖 Learning Objectives

By the end of this module, you will:

✅ Understand the purpose of **Amazon S3**, **AWS Glue**, **Amazon VPC**, **IAM**, and **Athena** in a data lake  
✅ Learn how these services work together to build a scalable data lake  
✅ Practice deploying and configuring these resources using Terraform

---

## 🏗️ Key Components

### 1️⃣ Amazon S3

✅ **Purpose:** Main storage layer for raw, processed, and curated data  
✅ **Analogy:** Like a giant, organized digital library

---

### 2️⃣ AWS Glue

✅ **Purpose:** Catalogs your data and runs basic ETL jobs  
✅ **Analogy:** The index and librarian of your data lake

---

### 3️⃣ Amazon VPC

✅ **Purpose:** Secure network environment for your data lake  
✅ **Analogy:** The private campus where your data lake resides

---

### 4️⃣ IAM (Identity and Access Management)

✅ **Purpose:** Controls who can access what in AWS  
✅ **Analogy:** The keys and roles for your data lake’s doors

---

### 5️⃣ Athena

✅ **Purpose:** Enables SQL queries directly on data in S3  
✅ **Analogy:** A fast search engine for your data lake

---

## 🚀 Real-World Architecture

A typical **AWS Data Lake** includes:

✅ S3 buckets for raw, processed, and curated data  
✅ Glue Data Catalog for table definitions  
✅ Secure networking with VPCs and subnets  
✅ IAM roles for access control  
✅ Athena for interactive analytics
