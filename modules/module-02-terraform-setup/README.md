# ⚙️ Module 02: Terraform Setup

Welcome to **Module 02**! Here, you’ll learn **why** setting up Terraform, the AWS CLI, and environment variables is crucial for working with infrastructure as code in real-world data projects.

---

## 📖 Why This Setup Matters

### 🟡 Why Install Terraform?

Terraform is the **engine** behind your Infrastructure as Code.  
✅ It lets you define cloud resources (like S3 buckets or VPCs) in code.  
✅ It **automates** deploying and updating these resources—no more manual clicking!  
✅ It ensures **consistency** and eliminates human error.

---

### 🟡 Why Install the AWS CLI?

The AWS CLI is your **command-line gateway** to AWS.  
✅ It’s how Terraform **authenticates** with AWS to create resources.  
✅ It’s also a great way to **test and validate** your AWS environment outside of Terraform.

---

### 🟡 Why Configure Environment Variables?

Environment variables let you:

✅ **Keep sensitive data safe** (like access keys) out of your code  
✅ Quickly switch between different AWS accounts or regions  
✅ Use best practices for security and collaboration

---

### 🟡 Putting It All Together

By the end of this module, you’ll have:

✅ Terraform installed and ready to deploy infrastructure  
✅ The AWS CLI installed and configured to talk to your AWS account  
✅ Environment variables set up to protect sensitive data  
✅ Confidence that your environment is ready for the rest of the course!
