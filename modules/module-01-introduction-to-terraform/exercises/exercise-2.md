# 📝 Exercise 2: Real-World Reflections

## Objective

See how IaC and Terraform can help you in a real data engineering scenario.

---

## Scenario

Imagine you need to:

✅ Create an S3 bucket for raw data  
✅ Register it in a Glue Data Catalog  
✅ Set up IAM roles for security  
✅ Query data with Athena

**Reflection**:  
- How would doing this manually (clicking in the AWS Console) feel?  
- What benefits do you see if you could **automate this whole setup** with Terraform?

**Analogy to consider**:  
- Terraform is like having a personal chef who always cooks your infrastructure “recipe” perfectly!

---

## Reflection

- What’s one real-world task in your current work that Terraform could automate?  
- How would you explain this to a new teammate?
