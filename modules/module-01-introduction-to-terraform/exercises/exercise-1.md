# 📝 Exercise 1: Understand IaC and Terraform

## Objective

Get comfortable with the **concept of Infrastructure as Code (IaC)** and how Terraform helps make it real.  
Let’s connect it to your daily work and start seeing the power of **automation**!

---

## Steps

✅ Read the section **"What is Infrastructure as Code (IaC)?"** in the module README.  
✅ Picture this scenario:  
> **"Imagine a data engineering team that needs to deploy data pipelines in 3 regions every day.  
Instead of setting up buckets, roles, and tables manually, they use Terraform to do it with a single command!"**

✅ Now, think of **1-2 repetitive tasks** you do often in your daily work (like setting up an S3 bucket or adjusting IAM policies).  
✅ Write a **short explanation** (3-4 sentences):  
- What does **IaC** mean to you?  
- How would automating these tasks with Terraform make your work easier?
