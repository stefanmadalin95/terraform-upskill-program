# 🌱 Module 01: Introduction to Terraform

Welcome to **Module 01**! In this module, you’ll explore what **Infrastructure as Code (IaC)** is, why it’s critical for data engineers, and how Terraform can make your infrastructure life easier.

---

## 📖 Learning Objectives

By the end of this module, you will:

✅ Understand the concept of **Infrastructure as Code (IaC)**  
✅ Learn what **Terraform** is and why it’s such a powerful tool  
✅ See how Terraform can simplify and secure your data engineering work  
✅ Connect these ideas to **real-world data engineering scenarios**

---

## 💡 Key Concepts

### 1️⃣ What is Infrastructure as Code (IaC)?

**IaC** is the practice of managing infrastructure using **code**, instead of manual clicks in the AWS Console.  
**Analogy:** Like writing down a recipe once and reusing it every time you cook—**no more guessing or rework**!

✅ **Why it matters for data engineers?**  
- Consistency: Same setup every time  
- Speed: Launch infrastructure in seconds  
- Collaboration: Share and version infrastructure code

### 2️⃣ What is Terraform?

Terraform is an **open-source tool** by HashiCorp that lets you write infrastructure as code in a simple language called **HCL** (HashiCorp Configuration Language).

✅ Works across many clouds: AWS, Azure, GCP  
✅ Enables **automation, security, and repeatability**  
✅ Lets data engineers focus on data pipelines, not endless setup!

---

### 3️⃣ Real-World Scenario

Imagine you need to build a data pipeline with:

✅ An S3 bucket for raw data  
✅ A Glue Data Catalog database  
✅ IAM roles for security

Instead of manually creating each piece, **Terraform can do it all in one shot**—like having a personal builder who always follows your blueprint.

## 💡 Exercises

✅ [Exercise 1: Discover IaC in Your Work](exercises/exercise-1.md)  
✅ [Exercise 2: Real-World Reflections](exercises/exercise-2.md)

Each exercise includes a short task and reflection questions—**no coding yet, just building context and curiosity!**
