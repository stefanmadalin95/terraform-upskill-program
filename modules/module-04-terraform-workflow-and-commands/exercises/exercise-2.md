# 📝 Exercise 2: Validate and Format Your Code

## Objective

Ensure your Terraform code is clean and correct.

## Steps

✅ Make a formatting mistake (e.g., remove indentation or add extra spaces)  
✅ Run:

```bash
terraform fmt
```
✅ Then run:

```bash
terraform validate
```

✅ Fix any errors if validation fails

## Reflection
- How does formatting help in team collaboration?
- Why is it useful to run validate before plan?
