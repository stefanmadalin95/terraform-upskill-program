# 📝 Exercise 1: Initialize a Terraform Project

## Objective

Use `terraform init` to prepare your project for deployment.

---

## Steps

✅ Create a new folder (or reuse Module 03 files)  
✅ Add `provider.tf` and `main.tf` (a basic S3 bucket)  
✅ Run:

```bash
terraform init
```

✅ Confirm that Terraform initialized successfully

## Reflection
- What does init actually do behind the scenes?
- What files/folders were created after running it?
