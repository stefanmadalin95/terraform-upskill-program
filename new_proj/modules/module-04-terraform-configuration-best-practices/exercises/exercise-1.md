# 📝 Exercise 1: Organize Your Terraform Files

## Objective

Practice creating a clean and organized file structure.

---

## Steps

✅ Create a new directory for a small Terraform project (e.g., creating an S3 bucket).  
✅ In this directory, create the following files:

- `main.tf` (with your provider and resource)  
- `variables.tf` (define at least one variable for region)  
- `outputs.tf` (output the bucket name)

✅ Initialize Terraform and verify your configuration with `terraform plan`.

---

## Reflection

- How does this structure make the configuration easier to manage?  
- How would you expand this if you had multiple resources?
