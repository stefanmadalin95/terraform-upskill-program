## Objective

Identify the core building blocks of Terraform and relate them to your data projects.

---

## Steps

‚úÖ Review the **"Terraform Core Components"** section in the module README.  
‚úÖ For each core component (Providers, Resources, Data Sources, Variables, Outputs, State), write down:
- A short definition in your own words.  
- A real-world example in a data engineering scenario (e.g., an S3 bucket as a resource, a data source for pulling VPC info).

‚úÖ Bonus: Sketch a small diagram (on paper or digital whiteboard) showing how these pieces might connect in a simple data lake deployment.

## Reflection

- Which core component do you think is most critical to a data lake deployment, and why?  
- Share one question you still have about any of these components.
