## Steps

‚úÖ Read the section **"What is Infrastructure as Code (IaC)?"** in the module README.  
‚úÖ Write a short explanation in your own words:
- What does **IaC** mean to you?  
- How does it improve your day-to-day work as a data engineer?

‚úÖ Think of 2-3 real-world scenarios in data engineering (like deploying an S3 bucket for raw data) where Terraform can save time.

## Reflection

- Why do you think versioning infrastructure code in Git is helpful?  
- How would you explain the difference between manual AWS console clicks and using Terraform to a teammate?
