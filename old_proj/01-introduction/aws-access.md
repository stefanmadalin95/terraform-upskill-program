# ðŸ”‘ How to Retrieve AWS Access Keys

AWS Access Keys are essential for connecting Terraform or any other AWS-integrated tools to your AWS account. Below are clear steps to retrieve your AWS Access Key ID and Secret Access Key:

## ðŸ“Œ Step-by-Step Guide

### âœ… Step 1: Log in to AWS Console

* Visit the [AWS Management Console](https://console.aws.amazon.com/) and log in.

### âœ… Step 2: Navigate to IAM

* In the AWS Management Console, search for or navigate to **IAM** (Identity and Access Management).

### âœ… Step 3: Access Users

* In the IAM dashboard, select **Users** from the sidebar.
* Click on your username (or the desired user).

### âœ… Step 4: Generate Access Keys

### âœ… Step 5: Retrieve Your Access Keys
